    Perlbal

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    This plugin changes the header Perlbal will use to delcare itself as a
    proxy.

    Usually Perlbal will add itself to X-Forwarded-For, but this plugins
    allows you to change that to any header you want, so you coudl differ
    Perlbal from other possible proxies the user might have.

    In your Perlbal configuration:

        LOAD ForwardedFor

        CREATE SERVICE http_balancer
          SET role      = reverse_proxy
          SET pool      = machines
          SET plugins   = RewriteHeader
          FORWARDED_FOR = X-Perlbal-Forwarded-For

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
load
    Register a global hook and check for configuration problems.

  register
    Register a service hook to run a callback to rewrite the header.

  rewrite_header
    The function that is called as the callback.

    Rewrites the *X-Forwarded-For* to whatever header name you specified in
